# Consortium for Sharing Technology used in RetinAl Imaging and Tracking (C-STRAIT)

C-STRAIT is group of labs who use scanning-laser opthalmoscopes to measure structure and function of human and animal visual systems. The mission of C-STRAIT is to share the technological innovations developed across the group.
